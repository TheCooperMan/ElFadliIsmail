# My website

I'm glad to publish my website where I share with you my projects and my travels.
Thanks to [cs50w](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/), a great course where I learn web development using Python and JavaScript.

_The website in progress .._

## Languages used ?

for the moment I'm using HTML, CSS and Python (using Flask, a  web framework based on Python).

## IDE used ?
Visual Studio Code.

## what's inside my website ?

the website contain 4 pages:

* **index.html** : represent the About me.
* **travel.html** : where I represent my travels, I used  [Bootstrapâ€™s cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/).
* **study.html** : in this page I created a table, with three columns and two rows.
* **portfolio.html** : where I represent the projects that I worked on. the same principle of the page travel.html is used in this page (Bootstrap's cards).
